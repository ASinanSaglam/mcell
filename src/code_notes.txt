Notes on MCell3



check on usage of struct species->species_id in viz_output.c when we get there...
  how do we use it, do we need it etc...

in struct species, do we really need D_ref?
  Ask Joel.


in struct species, do we really need separate viz_state and region_viz_value?
  Ask Joel and Boris.


In react_cond.c, check_probs(), fix printfs (should they be fprintfs or deleted?)

in mdlparse.y, will we ever need reaction groups?


in struct rxn, fix comment on rxn->next according to actual usage in prepare_reactions().


change struct molecule to struct volume_molecule !!!
change struct grid_molecule to struct surface_molecule !
