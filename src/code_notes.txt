Notes on MCell3



check on usage of struct species->species_id in viz_output.c when we get there...
  how do we use it, do we need it etc...

in struct species, do we really need D_ref?
  Ask Joel.


in struct species, do we really need separate viz_state and region_viz_value?
  Ask Joel and Boris.


In react_cond.c, check_probs(), fix printfs (should they be fprintfs or deleted?)

in mdlparse.y, will we ever need reaction groups?


in struct rxn, fix comment on rxn->next according to actual usage in prepare_reactions().


change struct molecule to struct volume_molecule !!!
change struct grid_molecule to struct surface_molecule !

change name of struct wall->effectors (to grid?)

Label subset of species flags that pertain to counting as "Count Flags".

check how we handle the lack of struct surface_grid->binding_factor during a
  reaction between a volume molecule and a surface species.  Surface_grid is NULL until
  a grid molecule is placed on the wall, but we need struct surface_grid->binding_factor
  to calculate reaction probability.

check how we initialize struct surface_grid->subvol (which subvol owns surface_grid?).

Note: it would save ~40% of struct subvolume memory usage if we got rid of BSP trees and
  therefore did not need struct subvolume->neighbor.  As the code is now written
  we don't actually allocate a single struct bsp_tree anywhere.
