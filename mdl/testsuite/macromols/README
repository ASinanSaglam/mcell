The files in this directory test various aspects of macromolecules.  The first
test can be validated by checking the equilibrium against an analyically
derived solution.  The second test can also be validated against an
analytically derived solution, as well as against a set of internal-consistency
relations between the various counts.  The 3rd and 4th tests are mainly for
validating different types of surface release, and are probably best validated
by hand-checking the viz output, though some validation can be done through the
reaction data.

 * Test 03: Surface macromolecule list release.
 * Test 04: Surface macromolecule init by density/number.

The invalid-?? files have intentional errors to test macromolecule parser error
handling in several categories.  The best test for these is to hand-inspect the
error message output, and ensure that it conveys enough information to allow
the user to quickly fix the problem.

  SUBUNIT[a, b] = species

    Since the topology of the species is 2-dimensional, each assignment must
    have a 2-D index (actually a range in each dimension), and each index must
    be inside the appropriate bounds for the particular dimension of the
    topology.  Where ranges are used, they must be non-empty (i.e. first bound
    is less than second bound):

        * invalid-01: Subunit assignment out of bounds
        * invalid-02: Subunit assignment range invalid
        * invalid-03: Subunit assignment out of bounds
        * invalid-04: Subunit assignment missing dim.
        * invalid-05: Subunit assignment extra dim.
        * invalid-06: Subunit assignment negative (1st)
        * invalid-07: Subunit assignment negative (2nd)

  SHAPE {
    SUBUNIT[a, b] = species
  }

    Again, the dimensionality of the index for the subunit must match the
    dimensionality of the topology of the complex, and none of the index
    coordinates may be out-of-bounds for their particular dimension.  Each
    subunit must have its location specified precisely once.

        * invalid-08: Subunit shape out of bounds
        * invalid-09: Subunit shape out of bounds
        * invalid-10: Subunit shape out of bounds
        * invalid-11: Subunit shape out of bounds
        * invalid-12: Subunit shape extra dim.

  SUBUNIT_RELATIONSHIPS {
    ring_negative = [ 0, -1]
  }

    The dimensionality of the subunit offset must match the topology of the
    complex.  The absolute value of the offset in any index coordinate must be
    less than the maximum value for that coordinate.  No relationship may
    appear more than once.  Any relationship which is used in a rate rule or
    counting table must be defined.

        * invalid-16: Subunit realtionship extra dim.
        * invalid-17: Subunit relationship missing dim.
        * invalid-18: Subunit relationship range error
        * invalid-19: Subunit relationship range error
        * invalid-20: Duplicate relationship
        * invalid-21: Unknown relationship

    }
  }

    No rate rule may appear more than once.  Subunit species may not be
    complexes.
    

        * invalid-22: Rate rule uses complex as subunit
        * invalid-23: Duplicate rate rule

    A reaction is valid only if neither side includes a subunit (parenthesized
    participant) or if both include exactly 1.

        * invalid-24: Two subunit reactants
        * invalid-25: Product missing subunit
        * invalid-26: Product has extra subunit
