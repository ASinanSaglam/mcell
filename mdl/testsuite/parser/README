This directory contains a suite of tests targetting the parser.  Right now, the
main test is the "kitchen sink" test, which attempts to exercise every
non-terminal in the parser, to the degree that this is possible.  According to
gcov, it achieves a reasonable degree of success.  Gradually, I'll add tests
that cover the rest of the parser -- mostly error conditions, but generally
constructs which are incompatible in some way with constructs in the kitchen
sink test.

 * Test 01: Nearly every parser option.
 * Test 02: Realtime checkpoint variants.

Below, I will attempt to document the error conditions we test for.

Checkpoint-related errors:
 * invalid-027: CHECKPOINT_ITERATIONS out of range
 * // Should discuss 0 as a value for CHECKPOINT_ITERATIONS.
   // Might be legitimate reasons for specifying 0 (for instance, to disable
   // iteration-based checkpointing via a variable setting.  Should either test
   // for failure when CHECKPOINT_ITERATIONS == 0, or should test for correct
   // behavior.
