This directory contains a suite of tests targetting the parser.  Right now, the
only test is the "kitchen sink" test, which attempts to exercise every
non-terminal in the parser, to the degree that this is possible.  According to
gcov, it achieves a reasonable degree of success.

 * Test 01: Nearly every parser option.
