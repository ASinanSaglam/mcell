This directory contains a suite of tests targetting the parser.  Right now, the
main test is the "kitchen sink" test, which attempts to exercise every
non-terminal in the parser, to the degree that this is possible.  According to
gcov, it achieves a reasonable degree of success.  Gradually, I'll add tests
that cover the rest of the parser -- mostly error conditions, but generally
constructs which are incompatible in some way with constructs in the kitchen
sink test.

 * Test 01: Nearly every parser option.
 * Test 02: Realtime checkpoint variants.
