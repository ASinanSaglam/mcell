The files in this directory test various aspects of reactions.  These are
derived from the tests I used for validation against old mcell behavior, as
well as against Boris' trimolecular code when I merged with macromolecules.
I'll give a summary below of what each file is, with more detailed information
in the header of each MDL file.

 * Test 01: All volume rxn types
 * Test 02: Only trimolecular volume reactions
 * Test 03: Bimolecular volume rxns, trad. versus trimol. code paths
 * Test 04: Bimolecular volume rxn equilibrium
 * Test 05: Bimolecular volume rxn rate of collision
