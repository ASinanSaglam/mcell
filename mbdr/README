Compilation of libmbd and the mbdr tool requires the following
dependencies. Please note that libmbd can be compiled separately.

libmbd:

- g++-4.*
- libbz2
- libz
- libtool

mbdr:

- g++-4.*
- libbz2
- libz
- boost (foreach and regex)


To build code simply type in the top level directory:

make build


To install 


make INSTALL_DIR=<path/to/install/directory> install


The default install directory is /usr and the makefile
will install the library, headers, and binary into 
/usr/lib, /usr/include, and /usr/bin, respectively.
